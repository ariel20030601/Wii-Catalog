# Wii Game Catalog

The main objective of this website is to provide a clean, performant, and user-friendly way to browse and search through a large database of Nintendo Wii games. It pulls data from a structured XML source and visually displays cover art taken through GameTDB API.

# Description

Wii Game Library Viewer is a web-based application that allows users to explore thousands of Wii games through an interactive grid layout. It reads data from a local wiitdb.xml file, parses it, and displays relevant game information including region, genres, publisher, and more. The cover art is taken using the GameTDB API and displayed in a card format.

Games can be searched using a live filtering input, and the layout is styled for responsiveness and accessibility. The search function is further optimized through debouncing to provide the user with a smooth experience.
Long descriptions (synopses) are automatically formatted into readable sections using JavaScript.

The application was created as a way to learn and explore handling large structured datasets (like XML), utilizing an API to display data, optimize frontend performance, and create a UI that balances aesthetics and function. It served as a learning tool, especially for working with raw XML data and dynamic React-based interfaces.

# Tools
This application was developed using React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with JavaScript for logic and XML parsing. The XML is read client-side using fast-xml-parser, and all data is stored locally for now (no backend).
Editor: Visual Studio Code
